# Sign-Language-to-Speech-Converter-using-Arduino
This project details a sign language-to-speech conversion system with Arduino, a flex sensor, and a 16Ã—2 LCD with I2C. It interprets hand gestures of speech-impaired people and converts them into audible speeches for people who do not use sign language; hence, it narrows the gap between them and improves social integration.
